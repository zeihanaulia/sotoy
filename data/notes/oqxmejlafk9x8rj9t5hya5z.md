Welcome to the homepage! I use Dendron to store and organize notes, ideas, and experiments I’m working on. Here are the main sections you’ll find on this site:

1. **Learning Notes** — Practical notes on programming, recent technologies, and productivity tips.
2. **Personal Projects** — Summaries of projects, experiments, and outcomes I’m working on or have completed.
3. **Writings & Opinions** — Casual articles and reflections about technology, daily life, and other interesting topics.

I’m constantly experimenting and learning. I hope the content here helps you as a reference, a starting point for discussion, or just light reading.

> Why Dendron?

Dendron helps keep notes organized. Its "seed" and "vault" concepts make it easy to structure content and find what you need.
