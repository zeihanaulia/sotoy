### Apa itu SAML, OAUTH2 dan OpenID Connect

### Design Questions

To get started on your own identity solution, we suggest thinking about the following questions in preparation for reading through the following chapters:

- Who are your users: employees, consumers, or a business?
- How will users log in? Is there an existing account available to them that they would like to reuse?
- Can your application be used anonymously or is authentication needed?
- What kind of delivery – Web or native – does your application intend to provide?
- Will your application need to call any APIs? If so, who owns the data that your application will retrieve?
- How will your application interact with APIs, both public APIs and your trusted subsystems?
- How sensitive is the data that your application handles?
- What access control requirements are needed?
- How long should a user stay logged in?
- Is there more than one application in your system? If so, will users benefit from single sign-on? (Don’t forget a support forum!)
- What should happen when users log out?
- Are there any compliance requirements associated with this data?
