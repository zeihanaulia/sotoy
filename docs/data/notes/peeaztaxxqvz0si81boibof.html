<p>To get started on your own identity solution, we suggest thinking about the following questions in preparation for reading through the following chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are your users: employees, consumers, or a business?</li>
<li>How will users log in? Is there an existing account available to them that they would like to reuse?</li>
<li>Can your application be used anonymously or is authentication needed?</li>
<li>What kind of delivery – Web or native – does your application intend to provide?</li>
<li>Will your application need to call any APIs? If so, who owns the data that your application will retrieve?</li>
<li>How will your application interact with APIs, both public APIs and your trusted subsystems?</li>
<li>How sensitive is the data that your application handles?</li>
<li>What access control requirements are needed?</li>
<li>How long should a user stay logged in?</li>
<li>Is there more than one application in your system? If so, will users benefit from single sign-on? (Don’t forget a support forum!)</li>
<li>What should happen when users log out?</li>
<li>Are there any compliance requirements associated with this data?</li>
</ul>
